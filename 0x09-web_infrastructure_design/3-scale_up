# 3-scale_up

## Overview

This infrastructure scales up the distributed web setup by adding:

- **1 additional server** to improve capacity.
- **HAProxy load balancer cluster** for redundancy and high availability.
- **Split components** into separate servers:
  - Web server (Nginx)
  - Application server
  - Database (MySQL)

## Why these additions?

- **Extra server**: Improves handling of increased traffic.
- **HAProxy cluster**: Removes the single point of failure in load balancing.
- **Splitting components**: Improves performance, allows independent scaling, and reduces resource contention.
